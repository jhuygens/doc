# Authorization Guide

## Client Credentials Flow

The Client Credentials flow is used in server-to-server authentication. 

This flow makes it possible to authenticate your requests to the Huygens Search API. For further information about this flow, see _Client Credentials Grant_ definition in [RFC-6749, section 4.4.](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749#section-4.4)

```
$ give me super-powers
```

{% hint style="info" %}
 Super-powers are granted randomly so please submit an issue if you're not happy with yours.
{% endhint %}

Once you're strong enough, save the world:

{% code title="hello.sh" %}
```bash
# Ain't no code for that yet, sorry
echo 'You got to trust me on this, I saved the world'
```
{% endcode %}
